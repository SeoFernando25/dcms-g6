        Q: What sort of Covid-19 precautions can I expect from your clinic?
      </h3>
      <h3>
        A: Currently, we are implementing all covid precautions mandated by the
        Government of Ontario. In addition to this, our clinic requires all
        staff to wear masks at all times. Our staff are also required to be
        vaccinated against Covid-19. If you feel that you might have Covid-19
        symptoms, we ask that you call us to reschedule your appointment.

        Q: Why are regular dental exams important?
      </h3>
      <h3>
        A: Going to the dentist on a regular basis is very important to ensure
        that you maintain good dental health. Regular appointments can help spot
        issues early on and help you avoid even bigger treatments later on. We
        recommend that all of our patients visit us at least every 6 months in
        order to help protect your teeth.

        appointment. If you would like to see what services we offer, please

        Q: My teeth seem fine. Should I still go to the dentist?
      </h3>
      <h3>
        A: Even if your teeth feel fine, it is important to visit the dentist
        because problems could arise without you realizing. Many dental issues
        become worse over time. If these issues are not treated right away, they
        can lead to more severe issues later on.
